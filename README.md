Project members: JJtheNOOB & [archer99076](https://github.com/archer99076)

__Goal__: To estimate apartment price based on information we can get from the website

- Step one - Pull data from the website
    - Target variable: price
    - Property type (1 bedroom, 2 bedroom etc)
    - Property geographic information (location, address etc..)
    - Property detailed information (Unit amenaties, building amenaties etc..)
    
- Step two -  Data Cleaning (modify data into the format that can be better analyzed)
